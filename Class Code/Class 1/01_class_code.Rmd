# R Setup and Required Packages

In this course, the open-source R programming language is used. R is maintained by an international team of developers who make the language available at [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/).  I recommend the [Hands-on Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/packages.html) for a brief overview of the software's functionality. 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

<!-- chunk names need to be unique -->

```{r packages}
## Checking to see whether the pacman package is installed
if(require(pacman) == FALSE) install.packages("pacman")

pacman::p_load(tidyverse, #tidyverse -- IMO needed for most of your analysis
               tidyquant, #tidyquant -- to be used for getting stock data
               magrittr) #magrittr -- loading to use the pipe operators
```

# Grammar of Graphics
The grammar of graphics is a **framework** which follows a **layered approach** to describe and construct visualizations or graphics in a **structured manner**. It was introduced by [Leland Wilkinson](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-28695-0) and has inspired the development of the [ggplot2 package](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) in R. In this course, we will often use the `ggplot2::ggplot()` to create graphs. 

> ''ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details''

```{r ggplotWebFigures, echo=FALSE, out.width="48%", fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://englelab.gatech.edu/useRguide/images/dataviz/ge_all.png")
``` 

## FANG Example
```{r data}
## Create an object and get our data
FANG = tq_get(x = c('AMZN', 'FB', 'GOOG', 'NFLX'), #stocks that we want
              from = '2020-01-01', #gets this date or the next trading date
              to = '2021-01-23') #gets data up to but not including the date
```

```{r fang}
## Let's build the plot
FANG %>% #layer 1: data (which gets passed for the first argument via the pipe)
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = date, y = adjusted, group = symbol, color = symbol)) + #layer 2: aesthetics
  geom_line() + #layer 3
  facet_wrap(~ symbol, ncol = 2, scales = 'free_y') + #layer 4: facets
  stat_smooth(method = 'loess') + #layer 5: fitting a local regression (optional)
  labs(x = 'Date', y = 'Adjusted Closing Price',
       caption = 'Data from 2020-01-02 to 2021-01-22') +
  theme_bw()

## Getting the starting date
FANG %>% 
  filter(date == '2020-01-02') %>%  #filter comes from dplyr, a row wise operation
  select(symbol, adjusted) -> #select is a column wise operation
  baseFANG

## Getting the ending date
FANG %>% 
  filter(date == '2021-01-22') %>%  #filter comes from dplyr, a row wise operation
  select(symbol, adjusted) -> #select is a column wise operation
  currentFANG

## Combine them into one
combinedFANG = left_join(x = baseFANG,
                         y = currentFANG,
                         by = 'symbol') #also comes from dplyr/tidyverse

## Change the column names
colnames(combinedFANG)[2:3] = c('base', 'current')

## Calculate the percent change
combinedFANG$pctChange = 100 * (combinedFANG$current - combinedFANG$base)/combinedFANG$base

print(combinedFANG)
```

The purpose of this repository is to maintain all code and data files covering topics in Business Forecasting. The repo is split into three main folders: Class Code,
Assignments, and the Final Project. Class code will be reviewed periodically to reinforce the concepts covered in each. I am pursuing this in hopes of continually 
refining my forecasting and general coding skills as I continue my studies.

All class code templates and data files came from the Business Forecasting course taught by Dr. Fadel Megahed at Miami University.
